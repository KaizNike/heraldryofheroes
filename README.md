Heraldry of Heroes: a game inspired by Darklands (Microprose, 1992), built in Godot game engine (V4.2.1)

This is an attempt to first create the bones of the game which can later be fleshed out with art and story in the form of 'scenerios'.
Scenarios consist of an image and a written description of the situation the party finds itself in with a list of options to choose from.
The game would progress from scenario to scenario, in a choose-your-adventure style.
Initially the game would be set entirely within one city in order to create depth before expanding it to the rest of Germany/Europe.

The bones of the game would consist of the following:
  ...user interface consisting of icons on left of screen for party members and a frame on the right to display scenarios and battles
  ...'scene changer' to change from one scenario to another
  ...party and character information sheet displaying skills, inventory, etc.
  ...player character creation system
  ...trading and inventory system
  ...saints and alchemy systems
  ...combat system

The main challenge is to create a fun and challenging combat system.
So far I've experimented with top-down view, turn-based combat that emphasizes footwork and balance (which foot the character has most of their weight on determines where they can move next)
But I'm not happy with where it's going so will think some more before committing too much time to this.

Others notes:
Copyrighted material from the original Darklands game is to be avoided, including art, writing and other original ideas of the game.
Thankfully much of the material is based off historical records so is not subject to copyright.

I've picked the MIT licence for this project. 

This is all an experiment and a bit of fun for me. I don't have any experience creating games or with Github so please let me know if you have any suggestions or would like to help with the project.
